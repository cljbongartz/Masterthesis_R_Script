# Masterthesis_R_Script
This repository contains the complete R-script used for my master thesis titled: **The Role of Bilateral Inferior Occipital Gyrus in Aversive Episodic Memory Encoding: A Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Study**.

The masterthesis is part of a larger pilot study. It compares a 30 Hz continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) protocol with a sham control stimulation to explore the potential involvement of the left and right inferior occipital gyri in aversive episodic memory performance.
